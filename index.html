        <p>
            For the avid cyclist, who wants to uncover part of Ireland‚Äôs Wild Atlantic Way, the South Kerry Greenway is the ideal way to spend a day exploring the Iveragh Peninsula. Stretching from the charming town of Glenbeigh, you can cycle over the Gleensk Viaduct, hugging the abandoned railway tracks past picturesque Kells Bay. The 27km long track also brings you through the historical town of Cahersiveen up to Reenard Point, where you can get the Ferry to Valentia Island. Plenty of breathtaking views and stops along the way will undoubtedly make the journey worthwhile!

                <p>
                    Often dubbed the ‚ÄúJewel in the Ring of Kerry‚Äù, the greater Glenbeigh area includes Glenbeigh town, Rossbeigh Beach and Mountain Station. The quaint town of Glenbeigh is particularly worth a visit during the Summer months for people who are avid sports fans or enjoy a scenic walk along the Kerry Way. Dooks Links Course will keep any golf fan occupied for hours and horse racing on Rossbeigh Beach at the end of the Summer is worth visiting Glenbeigh alone! Glenbeigh is an ideal spot to start your South Kerry Greenway trip, due to the plethora of pubs and accommodation in the town or nearby Killorglin.

                <p>
                    Once part of the Great Southern and Western Railway Line stretching from Valentia Island, near Reenard, to Farranfore, where Kerry Airport is located, the Gleensk Viaduct closed in 1960 and has been partially used as a walking route. With the completion of the South Kerry Greenway, the eleven-span steel girder railway viaduct will be fully crossable and will allow you to reach Kells. Kells boasts a blue flag beach and spectacular views of Dingle Bay and the Blasket Islands. Kells is also famed for its internationally renowned Kells Bay Gardens, home to Ireland‚Äôs longest rope bridge and various rare sub-tropical plants.

                <p>
                    The largest town along the South Kerry Greenway route, Cahersiveen has a plethora of activities and tourist attractions, making it a pivotal stop on your cycling journey. As part of the Kerry International Dark-Sky Reserve, enjoy the beautiful, starry skies at night and enjoy nearby Cuas Crom and White Strand beaches during the day. Cahersiveen is an ideal location for a spoke and hub holiday, with a focal location on the Ring of Kerry and close proximity to both the Skelligs and Valentia Island. Home of ‚ÄúThe Liberator‚Äù, Daniel O‚ÄôConnell, a 19th century leader in Irish politics, the town is brimming with historical importance.
