# South Kerry Greenway

# Introduction

## Project Aim
Welcome to a website dedicated to the newly confirmed South Kerry Greenway! It will stretch along the South Kerry Coast for 27km and enable all cyclists to visit 3 key areas on the Iveragh Peninsula – Glenbeigh town, Gleensk Viaduct & Kells Bay, and finally, Cahersiveen town.

The website's primary aim is to provide the user with information about the new cycleway, such as the route, stops and any upcoming events in towns along the route – attracting new tourists to the area. It will also allow any tourists to ask any questions regarding the route via a contact form just above the footer.
